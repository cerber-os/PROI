# Project 1
Create class representing set of real numbers. Maximum size of set is predetermined value by user. Following features should be implemented:
  - Element addition
  - Element deletion
  - Check if set contains given element
  - Return current size of set
  - Union of sets (operators + and +=)
  - Difference of sets (operators - and -=)
  - Intersection of sets (operators * and *=)
  - Check equality of sets (operators == and !=)
  - Print out sets (operator <<)
